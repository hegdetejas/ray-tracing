# RAY TRACING

## **Milestone 1**
<br>

### **Context**


The aim of this assignment is to visualize the reflection of photons off an object observed on a window.
<br>
<br>

### **Processor & Compiler**

```
Chip:               Apple M1 Pro
Number of Cores:	8 (6 performance and 2 internal)
Compiler:           GNU C++ Compiler Version 11 (g++-11)
```
<br>

### **Usage**
1. Ensure you have `g++-11` installed.
2. cd src/
3. ./run.sh

This will run the program and produce the visualisation in /out/sphere.png

<br>

### **Output**
The following is the output that was produced using 1,000,000,000 rays and a window size of 1,000x1,000
